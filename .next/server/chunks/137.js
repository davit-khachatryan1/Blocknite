As you can see, 80% of our funds are allocated toward “Ecosystem”. These are tokens that will be slowly created over time and issued to our users as rewards for playing our game.

Do not worry, only carefully built smart contracts are calling these mint functions, they are not open to anything else."},{title:"Is the team Doxxed?",description:"The team is not currently Doxxed.

We love what we have built so far and we aspire to continue building, adding brand new features to keep you happy. As such, we are required to keep control of the contracts.
